SandwichStream\n\n[![Travis CI Test Status](https://travis-ci.org/connrs/node-sandwich-stream.png)](https://travis-ci.org/connrs/node-sandwich-stream)\n\nWhile I'm not overjoyed about how performant the internals will operate, I wanted a readable stream that was ACTUALLY A READABLE STREAM. Not a streams1 stream masquerading as streams2. As soon as somebody writes a better concat stream as a readable stream with a nice simple API, this baby is going to develop some serious abandonment issues.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install sandwich-stream\n\n## Usage\n\n    var sandwichStream = require('sandwich-stream');\n    var ss = sandwichStream({\n      head: 'Thing at the top\\n',\n      tail: '\\nThing at the bottom',\n      separator: '\\n ---- \\n'\n    });\n    ss.add(aStreamIPreparedEarlier);\n    ss.add(anotherStreamIPreparedEarlier);\n    ss.add(aFurtherStreamIPreparedEarlier);\n    ss.pipe(process.stdout);\n\n    // The thing at the top\n    //  ---- \n    // Stream1\n    //  ---- \n    // Stream2\n    //  ---- \n    // Stream3\n    // The thing at the bottom\n\nThe `head` option takes a string/buffer and pushes the string before all other content\n\nThe `foot` option takes a string/buffer and pushes the string after all other data has been pushed\n\nThe `separator` option pushes a string/buffer between each stream\n\nToo add a stream use the .add method: `ss.add(streamVariable);`\n","maintainers":[{"name":"connrs","email":"paul.connolley@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-08-09T07:28:08.705Z","created":"2013-08-30T22:51:25.616Z","0.0.1":"2013-08-30T22:51:28.404Z","0.0.2":"2013-08-30T23:11:32.012Z","0.0.3":"2013-08-30T23:23:46.361Z","0.0.4":"2013-08-31T12:14:23.446Z","1.0.0":"2015-08-09T07:28:08.705Z"},"author":{"name":"connrs"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/connrs/node-sandwich-stream.git"},"homepage":"https://github.com/connrs/node-sandwich-stream","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/connrs/node-sandwich-stream/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"8cd6e1372d81130293d9c31ef46781dc\"","_lastModified":"Sun, 27 May 2018 16:35:23 GMT","_cached":true}
