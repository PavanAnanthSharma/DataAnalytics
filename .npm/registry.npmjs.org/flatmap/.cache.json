require('flatmap');\n```\n\nJust like `map`, `flatMap` accepts three arguments:\n\n  * the `array` to be traversed\n  * the `iterator` function, which is invoked with three parameters\n\n        * `value` currently iterated\n        * optional `index` of current iteration\n        * and optional `array` being iterated\n\n  * the `context` value, which will be `this` inside the `iterator` function.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nflatMap(['Hi', 'World'], function(word) {\n  return word.split('');\n});\n// ['H', 'i', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']\n```\n\nThe `iterator` function can return either a value (in that case it is simply appended to results) or an array (in that case the array is concatenated with results).\n\nReturning `null` or `undefined` from `iterator` will append nothing to the results.\n\n**Heads up!** This is not equivalent to `_.compose(_.flatten, _.map)`, since nested sub-arrays are **not flattened**.\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2013 Boris Okunskiy
