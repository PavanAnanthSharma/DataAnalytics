With Truffle, you get:\n\n* Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.\n* Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai.\n* Configurable build pipeline with support for custom build processes.\n* Scriptable deployment & migrations framework.\n* Network management for deploying to many public & private networks.\n* Interactive console for direct contract communication.\n* Instant rebuilding of assets during development.\n* External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.\n\n### Install\n\n```\n$ npm install -g truffle\n```\n\n### Quick Usage\n\nFor a default set of contracts and tests, run the following within an empty project directory:\n\n```\n$ truffle init\n```\n\nFrom there, you can run `truffle compile`, `truffle migrate` and `truffle test` to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.\n\nTruffle comes bundled with a local development blockchain server that launches automatically when you invoke the commands  above. If you'd like to [configure a more advanced development environment](http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration) we recommend you install the blockchain server separately by running `npm install -g ganache-cli` at the command line. \n\n+  [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli): a command-line version of Truffle's blockchain server.\n+  [ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/): A GUI for the server that displays your transaction history and chain state.\n\n\n### Documentation\n\nPlease see the [Official Truffle Documentation](http://truffleframework.com/docs/) for guides, tips, and examples.\n\n### Contributing\n\nThis package is a distribution package of the Truffle command line tool. Please see [truffle-core](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-core) to contribute to the main core code.\n\n### License\n\nMIT\n",
